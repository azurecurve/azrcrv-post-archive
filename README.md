# Description

The Post Archive plugin is based on [Ozh Tweet Archive - a theme for Wordpress](http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/ozh-tweet-archive-theme-for-wordpress/). The tweet archive was extracted, enhanced and turned into this plugin which lets the posts archive to be displayed in a page or in a widget.

Widgets can be limited in the number of years they display as well as have footer text, such as a link to a page containing the full archive in a shortcode.

This plugin is multisite compatible; each site will need settings to be configured in the admin dashboard.
